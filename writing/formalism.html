                <p class='par-text'> Early formalism can be characterized as an attempt to sidestep the many
                ontological and metaphysical difficulties that arise in other philosophies of mathematics.
                Early formalism can be broadly divided into two positions, that of the term
                formalist, and that of the game formalist. Where the game formalist "seeks to banish
                all semantic notions from mathematics", the term formalist attempts to "reduce any
                such notions to purely syntactic ones" (Linnebo, 2017, p. 73). We will first briefly
                walk through the ideas of the early formalists and present the ideas of their
                most notable opponent, before concluding with a look at a slightly more modern take on formalism.</p>
                
                <p class='par-text'> The view of the term formalist is that singular terms in mathematical
                expressions refer to themselves rather than the numbers they denote.
                The upshot of this is that we then have no reason to doubt the existence
                of a number whatsoever, since once we write a symbol we have no reason to doubt
                the existence of the symbol. So, finally we have no reason to doubt what the symbol
                denotes. Thus we can assert that numbers exist with absolute confidence.</p>
                
                <p class='par-text'> Now, the term formalist seeks to define functional symbols of arithmetic, such as
                '+' or '✕'. We define these based on rewrite rules<sup>1</sup>. These rewrite rules allow
                us to give mathematical formulas meaning. For example, we can show that '<span class='math'>5 + 5 = 10</span>'
                by showing that we can reduce '<span class='math'>5 + 5</span>' to '<span class='math'></span>10</span>' via our rewrite rules. 
                We can generalize this to say that the truth of an arithmetical expression, say '<span class='math'>a = b</span>', is really just the ability to
                transform (via rewrite rules) one term into the other.</p>
                
                <p class='par-text'> Where the term formalist seeks to reduce semantics notions within mathematics,
                the game formalist seeks to eliminate them entirely. This
                view distinguishes itself from term formalism by claiming that arithmetic is not
                a theory of symbols, but rather a game of manipulations played with such symbols.
                The game formalist sees mathematics as a game, similar to chess, that we play with
                empty syntactical expressions. This means that numbers are meaningless within the
                game, beyond the properties assigned to them with respect to the rules of the game.
                A parallel can be drawn with chess, where pieces on a board have no meaning beyond
                the rules that we assign to them that dictate their behaviour within the game.
                
                <p class='par-text'> The flavour of formalism peddled by the early school of formalists is not
                one that was popularized by its proponents, but rather by its opponents. The
                most notable work on early formalism is a take-down job by the great Gottlob Frege in
                <i>The Foundations of Arithmetic</i> (1903). In it, he attacks two notable defendants
                of early formalism: game formalist J. Thomae and term formalist E. Heine. Frege outlines three main points in his
                criticism of Thomae and Heine in <i>The Foundations of Arithmetic</i>.
                These are: (i) Arithmetic has applications that cannot be justified if we consider it to be
                'empty'; (ii) Thomae blurs the line between the 'formal arithmetic/game'
                and the metatheory of the game; and (iii) Neither Heine nor Thomae are able to offer an explanation
                of infinity within their theories. We will now detail Frege's criticisms of Thomae
                and Heine before finally turning to Haskell Curry's version of formalism to see how it
                stands up against Frege.
                
                <p class='par-text'>The applicability of arithmetic is one that Frege hones in on as a particular
                weak spot of Thomae's game formalist argument.
                <p class='quote'>
                Why can no application be made of a configuration of chess pieces? Obviously,
                because it expresses no thought.... Why can arithmetical equations be applied?
                Only because they express thoughts.... Now, it is applicability alone which
                elevates arithmetic from a game to the rank of a science. So applicability
                necessarily belongs to it. (<i>Frege Against The Formalists</i>, Sec. 91)
                </p>
                Let us first examine what applicability means in this context. M. Resnik makes the claim
                that Frege is speaking of "inferential applications", let us proceed with this
                assumption. In this context, "inferential applications" is taken to mean
                chains of reasoning that allow us to conclude some truth, where that truth has
                some analogy to reality. Take the example provided by Resnik (p. 62), where
                we begin with some knowledge: "A 10 foot by 6 foot floor" and "area in square feet equals length in feet times width in
                feet",
                which allows us to conclude that (1) '<span class='math'>10 ✕ 6 = 60</span>', and so (2) 'area in square feet = <span class='math'>60</span>'.
                This is an example of applying arithmetic wherein we are expressing a true statement, <span class='math'>10 ✕ 6 = 60</span>,
                that has analogy to reality, the reality being that a 10 by 6 floor has an area of 60 square feet.
                But in Thomae's conception, our concluding equation is <i>empty</i>. How can <span class='math'>10 ✕ 6 = 60</span> be both empty and have
                an analogy to reality?
                
                It is clear there's an issue here. If Thomae wants his expressions to
                be empty, he cannot allow them to be empirically verifiable. For, if this were the case,
                it is clear that there is some meaningful arithmetic being supposed within Thomae's
                system. But analogy is inescapable, because as Frege says, "applicability necessarily
                belongs to [arithmetic]" (Frege, Sec. 91).</p>
                
                <p class='par-text'> Thomae's game formalism, at various points, appears to suffer from lack of
                clarity. The place that Frege sees the most issue is within the
                lack of distinction between the game of mathematics and the <i>theory</i> of the game of
                mathematics (or the "metatheory"). Frege accuses Thomae of presupposing meaningful
                arithmetic in his formal arithmetic. Thomae lists a handful of rules
                for his arithmetic, including commutativity, associativity, and so forth. But this
                does not make sense, says Frege. By listing a rule, such as <span class='math'>a + a' = a' + a</span>,
                we encounter many questions. The first for Frege is whether we are to treat each symbol
                as a sign or only as "figures", as Frege calls them. For, if we treat them as mere figures,
                stating such a rule is equivalent to showing a chess position to someone with no knowledge
                of the game in order to explain a rule of chess. If, on the other hand, we treat
                symbols as referential signs, we end up with a rule of meaningful arithmetic, rather
                than a formal expression! And so, Thomae's formal arithmetic is not a formal arithmetic
                at all.</p>
                
                <p class='par-text'> A final simple, but important, retort is that of infinity. Frege makes a
                "homely objection":
                <p class='quote'>
                    In order to produce [an infinite series] we would need an infinitely
                    long blackboard, an infinite supply of chalk, and an infinite length of
                    time. (Frege, 1903, Sec. 124)
                </p>
                Heine's theory does not have a strong defense against this argument, Frege
                claims that Heine is victim of a "curious fate: the tangibility of numbers" (ibid. Sec. 124).
                For, if numbers are taken to exist only by their tangibility, how can we claim that
                any irrational number exists? On the other hand, Thomae provides a slightly more sophisticated approach
                to the issue of infinities, providing a rule by which to call a sequence infinite.
                But Frege still finds flaw with this, because Thomae relies upon the notion of a
                sequence <i>possibly</i> being continued indefinitely. But of course it is not possible
                for humans to inscribe symbols indefinitely. Neither Heine nor Thomae can coherently
                explain infinities within their conception. This is a major flaw. Frege concludes
                that defining such notions based on human capacities is a futile endeavour.</p>
                
                <p class='par-text'>In contrast to the game and term formalism of Thomae and Heine, Haskell
                Curry's formal systems, presented in <i>Outlines of a Formalist Philosophy of
                Mathematics</i>(1951), offer a possible way out of the many problems concerning Thomae
                and Heine. Although, Curry's formalism is not completely free of issues and raises
                some important ontological questions that Curry shies away from answering in his
                thesis. We will first discuss whether Curry's formalism is able to withstand the
                arguments presented by Frege against Thomae and Heine before turning to the broader
                ontological questions posed by Resnik in <i>Frege and the Philosophy of Mathematics</i> (1980).</p>
                
                
                <p class='par-text'> The major advantage to Curry's theories as opposed to Thomae and Heine's, and one that Resnik immediately points
                out is the "precision with which [Curry] formulates his theory" (ibid., p. 69). Resnik provides
                a laundry list of advantages to Curry's formalism over the early formalists, but chief among them
                are the lack of reliance on contentful mathematics, the preservation of meaning within
                mathematics, and a clear definition of truth. One will note that
                Curry's formalism also allows us to sidestep the question of infinity that Frege presented
                the early formalists simply by defining the notion of an infinite sequence as internal to some theory.
                As well, since Curry preserves the "meaning of mathematics", he is able to avoid
                questions posed by Frege concerning 'applicability'. So, it seems that Curry's
                formalism does a very good job avoiding issues pointed out by Frege some 50 years
                earlier. One may look to developments in metamathematics between Frege's writings
                and Curry's thesis as a reason for the apparent fortitude of Curry's work. But,
                Curry's formalism is not without flaws, and in fact, there is an important ontological
                question that I think discounts Curry's formalism as a viable philosophy of mathematics.</p>
                
                <p class='par-text'>Curry was rather dismissive with regards to the ontological
                questions concerning his brand of formalism.
                <p class='quote'>
                    It is unnecessary to inquire further into the meaning of a formal system.
                    It is characteristic of mathematics that it considers only certain essential
                    properties of its objects, regarding others as irrelevant. One of these irrelevant questions
                    is that of the ontology of a formal system. The question of which representation
                    is the real or essential one is a metaphysical matter with which mathematics
                    has no concern. (Curry, 1951, 30 - 31)
                </p>
                But in fact, a major flaw of Curry's system quickly becomes evident when one begins asking such questions.
                At the core of Curry's theory is the idea that mathematicians are doing no more
                than showing certain propositions are true in certain formal systems. But this quickly raises
                the question, by what logic "such and such is a theorem of such and such
                formal system" (Resnik, p. 65)? Or, more precisely, in what logical system are we able to claim
                that "formal system X proves proposition Y"? Curry doesn't commit to a clear
                ontology here, and in fact goes so far as to call any ontological commitment "irrelevant".
                This allows us to claim that the logic by which we claim "B proves C" is <i>also</i> a formal system!
                Now, we have the claim that "system A proves system B proves C".
                It is no big leap to see that we will quickly end up with infinitely many "metatheories" proving
                claims about other metatheories with this logic. This seems like an issue, for if all we have is infinitely many
                metatheories, any proof is really just a formal deduction within some metatheory. Curry has not provided
                any reasoning for us to believe that we can derive any real truth from our formal systems.
                The fact that Curry doesn't present a resolution, and goes so far as to dismiss such questions as irrelevant,
                should be quite distressing<sup>2</sup>.</p>
                
                <p class='par-text'>It is clear that while some brands of formalism are able to
                avoid some metaphysical, ontological, and other difficulties that are common in other
                sorts of philosophies of mathematics, they are definitely not without flaw. Both
                game and term formalism received quite a severe take down from Frege. And while
                Curry's work seemed to avoid Frege's criticisms, it is not without it's own issues.
                To me, formalism still seems like a interesting and useful philosophy, and while more attractive
                philosophies such as game formalism are fraught with problems, one may wonder
                whether there is a variety of formalism that could serve as a viable philosophy
                of mathematics.</p>

                <span style='font-size: 75%'><sup>2</sup>I will briefly add that Curry provided something of a response to the final 
                    criticisms presented here in the brief note <i>Remarks On The Definition and Nature of Mathematics</i>.
                    As far as I am concerned, this article does nothing to refute any of the points made here, or by any of
                    Curry's critics. Curry does not discuss truth in any meaningful way, and I believe <i>acceptability</i> is 
                    a cop-out to dealing with issues of truth. As such, his article does not resolve any issues originally discussed.
